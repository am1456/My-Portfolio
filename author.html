        <p class="intro-text">As a college student, writing is my hobby and creative outlet. While balancing studies and
            other commitments, I find time to explore storytelling and share my imagination with readers around the
            world.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>My Journey to Writing</h2>
        <p>I come from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_culture" target="_blank"
                onclick="playClick()">Bengali</a> family where we have a huge influence of extracurricular activities
            like singing, dancing, and recitation. My family has people who are pursuing singing as their career and
            teaching profession. Hence, I was also drawn into singing, and in Bengali singing, we have a totally
            different journey which belongs to Kobi Guru <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore"
                target="_blank" onclick="playClick()">Rabindranath Tagore</a>, called <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindra_Sangeet" target="_blank" onclick="playClick()">Rabindra
                Sangeet</a>. Those songs are still my favorites, which introduced me to Rabindranath Tagore and later <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazi_Nazrul_Islam" target="_blank" onclick="playClick()">Kazi Nazrul
                Islam</a>.</p>

        <p>Later, when I got introduced to other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_literature"
                target="_blank" onclick="playClick()">Bengali literature</a> in my school days, I discovered other great
            writers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankim_Chandra_Chatterjee" target="_blank"
                onclick="playClick()">Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay</a>, <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarat_Chandra_Chattopadhyay" target="_blank"
                onclick="playClick()">Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay</a>, and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibhutibhushan_Bandyopadhyay" target="_blank"
                onclick="playClick()">Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay</a> and many other talented writters. The story that
            influenced me most is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pather_Panchali" target="_blank"
                onclick="playClick()"><em>Pather Panchali</em></a> (my favorite novel, and I remember each line of that
            story). Till that time, my reach in literature is only where my school taught us‚Äînot a single point above it.</p>

        <p>Then I passed Class 10, and Class 11 turned out to be the most depressing year of my life. Even after
            studying intensely, I couldn't score much. I am an average student, not a topper, but I usually used to get
            85%, but in Class 11, I got 65%+. As a result, I fell into depression.</p>

        <p>To cope with this depression, I started watching animation, more specifically <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime" target="_blank" onclick="playClick()">Anime</a> and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donghua_(term)" target="_blank" onclick="playClick()">Donghua</a>.
            It just opened a fascinating world in front of me. Then I started reading <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga" target="_blank" onclick="playClick()">Manga</a> and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhua" target="_blank" onclick="playClick()">Manhua</a>, and then
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_novel" target="_blank" onclick="playClick()">Light Novels</a>,
            and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_novel" target="_blank" onclick="playClick()">Web
                Novels</a> written by the anime's original authors. This introduced me to worlds linked to the world of
            animation. And here I am now, writing a web novel myself.</p>

        <div class="quote-box">
            "From Bengali literature to anime, from depression to creativity‚Äîevery experience shaped my journey as a
            storyteller."
        </div>

        <p>When I came to college, I got some free time in my first year to think about a story. Along with that, I met
            a college mate of mine with whom I discussed a basic story structure‚Äîwhat could happen in the story and how
            to progress it. (By the way, this is not the present version because I underwent many modifications.)</p>

        <p>Finally, when I came back home during my summer break, a rough sketch of the story was inside my mind. But
            still, I did many hit and trials. I used to write even five chapters but couldn't progress beyond it. Hence,
            I needed to scrap it and start from the beginning. And now I am where I am.</p>

        <p>Finally, in the month of August 2024, I posted my story on Royal Road. Things are growing pretty good for me,
            at least.</p>

        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <p>I'm very new to this field of creative writing. While my English fulfills the standard that a story needs to
            have, I occasionally use AI to correct my grammar and refine my prose. In the future, I want to become
            independent from using AI and work on the craft of writing‚Äîto learn more about how to tell a story
            effectively and develop my own unique voice.</p>

        <p>This portfolio was initially created to showcase my web development journey, but later I thought‚Äîif I'm
            making one, why not make it for my author journey as well? Both paths represent different sides of my
            creativity, and I'm grateful to share them with you.</p>

        <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about my writing. I hope you'll check out my work and join me on this
            creative adventure!</p>
